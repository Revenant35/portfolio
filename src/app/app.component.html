      <h2>Real-time Pose Estimation Pipeline</h2>
      <p>
        I constructed my own realtime pose estimation pipeline using CV fundamentals and Tensorflow. The pipeline was able
        to detect and track human poses in real-time using a webcam feed. The pipeline was built using a custom-trained
        PoseNet model and was able to detect multiple poses simultaneously. The resulting poses were then rendered on the
        webcam feed in real-time.

      <h2>Medication Logging Application</h2>
      <p>
        I developed a medication logging iOS application called TapRx. TapRx was designed to help users keep track of their
        medications and when they should take them. The application featured a medication list, a schedule, and a dashboard
        to help users visualize their medication intake. The frontend was built using Swift and SwiftUI, while the backend
        was built using Flask and Firebase.

      <h2>Illumica</h2>
      <p>
        As a founder of Illumica, I have been working on a healthcare analytics platform that helps healthcare providers
        visualize and analyze their patient data. The platform features a dashboard, a pose estimation pipeline, and
        analytics tools to help healthcare providers make informed decisions about their patients. The platform is built
        using Angular, Node.js, and MariaDB.

    <h1>ðŸ§¨ Hot Takes</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Agile is inefficient and wastes developer time.</li>
      <li>OOP is great, but a foot-gun to new developers.</li>
      <li>The 10x engineer is a myth and teamwork always outshines individual brilliance.</li>
      <li>Code reviews are an amazing tool for learning and collaboration.</li>
      <li>Testing is a must, but over-testing can be a waste of time.</li>
